# d-3 Patti

The project aims to develop a blockchain based multiplayer card game, a variant of poker popularly known as 3-patti in India, that provides a secure and trustless environment for players.
Players will only need to connect using their wallet providing complete anonymity and eliminating the need of any prior registrations. The game is built using smart contracts which will handle all the transactions and enforce the rules of the game such as transferring money to the pot for placing a bet. To ensure fairness, the application uses a random number generator and follows the standard rules of the game.
